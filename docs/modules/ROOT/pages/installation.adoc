= Installation

There are two ways to run the Stackable Listener Operator:

1. Helm managed Docker container deployment on Kubernetes

2. Build from source


== Helm
Helm allows you to download and deploy Stackable operators on Kubernetes and is by far the easiest installation method. First ensure that you have installed the Stackable Operators Helm repository:

[source,console]
----
$ helm repo add stackable https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/helm-stable/
----

Then install the Stackable Listener Operator

[source,console]
----
$ helm install listener-operator stackable/listener-operator
----

Helm will deploy the operator in Kubernetes containers and apply the CRDs. You're now ready to expose services!

== Building the operator from source
