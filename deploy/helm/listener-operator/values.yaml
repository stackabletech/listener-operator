# When running on a non-default Kubernetes cluster domain, the cluster domain can be configured here.

# Options: none, stable-nodes, ephemeral-nodes
# none: No ListenerClasses are preinstalled, administrators must supply them themselves
# stable-nodes: ListenerClasses are preinstalled that are suitable for on-prem/"pet" environments, assuming long-running Nodes but not requiring a LoadBalancer controller
# ephemeral-nodes: ListenerClasses are preinstalled that are suitable for cloud/"cattle" environments with short-lived nodes, however this requires a LoadBalancer controller to be installed
preset: stable-nodes
