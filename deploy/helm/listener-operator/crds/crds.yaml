                  description: |-
                    Whether or not a Pod exposed using a NodePort should be pinned to a specific Kubernetes node.

                    By pinning the Pod to a specific (stable) Kubernetes node, stable addresses can be
                    provided using NodePorts. The pinning is achieved by listener-operator setting the
                    `volume.kubernetes.io/selected-node` annotation on the Listener PVC.

                    However, this only works on setups with long-living nodes. If your nodes are rotated on
                    a regular basis, the Pods previously running on a removed node will be stuck in Pending
                    until you delete the PVC with the pinning.

                    Because of this we don't enable pinning by default to support all environments.

                Exposes a set of pods to the outside world.

                Essentially a Stackable extension of a Kubernetes Service. Compared to a Service, a Listener changes three things:
                1. It uses a cluster-level policy object (ListenerClass) to define how exactly the exposure works
                2. It has a consistent API for reading back the exposed address(es) of the service
                3. The Pod must mount a Volume referring to the Listener, which also allows
                   ["sticky" scheduling](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/listener-operator/listener#_sticky_scheduling).
